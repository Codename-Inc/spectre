- Merged Steps 5 and 7 in scope.md to eliminate redundant confirmation loop — final review now includes Next Steps footer inline, allowing user to reply with edits or jump directly to commands without intermediate approval
- Refactored presentation flow so @skill-spectre:spectre-next-steps renders immediately after scope document review, preventing delay between decision and action
- Removed blocking "Let me know if anything needs adjusting" pattern and replaced with non-blocking "User can interrupt with corrections if needed" note, aligning with fast-execution philosophy

- Refactored presentation flow so @skill-spectre:spectre-next-steps renders immediately after scope document review, preventing delay between decision and action
- Reordered steps so Light Technical Context (Step 5) runs before final review, ensuring technical findings are baked into scope doc before user sees it
- Removed blocking "Let me know if anything needs adjusting" pattern and replaced with non-blocking "Reply with edits or pick next step" note, aligning with fast-execution philosophy
- Fixed orphaned Step 6 technical context gathering by moving it upstream in command execution flow (before review rather than after)
