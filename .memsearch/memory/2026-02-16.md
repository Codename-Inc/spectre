- Load feature-spectre-plugin skill to understand Next Steps footer pattern and command architecture
- Current pattern: commands end with @skill-spectre:spectre-next-steps footer providing contextual navigation
- Proposal: enhance /clean and /test commands to recommend /evaluate or /learn after achieving clean branch state
- Rationale: closing the loop ensures feature is fully documented before checkin — moving from "code ready" to "feature documented and ready to ship"
- Need to modify: clean.md and test.md command prompts to add explicit guidance about documentation phase after branch is clean
- Design decision: determine if this should be a conditional recommendation (only when branch is actually clean) or always shown
- Discussion needed: where in the output flow should this recommendation appear — in footer, in success message, or both
