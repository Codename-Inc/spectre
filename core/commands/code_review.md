# code_review: Comprehensive Code Analysis

## Description
- Description — Conduct thorough, comprehensive code analysis covering all aspects of code quality, security, and production readiness. Provides comprehensive analysis in single review session with severity-based findings and actionable recommendations.
- Desired Outcome — Complete code review report with severity-categorized findings (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), comprehensive scores, prioritized action plan, saved to a scoped report file (default `comprehensive_code_review.md`, but use a scoped filename if one already exists).

## ARGUMENTS Input

Optional user input to seed this workflow.

<ARGUMENTS>
$ARGUMENTS
</ARGUMENTS>

## Step (1/4) - Define Review Scope

- **Action** — ProcessGuidance: Check for ARGUMENTS and extract guidance.
  - **If** ARGUMENTS exists → acknowledge guidance; extract specific focus areas;
  - Proceed with comprehensive review while honoring context
- **Action** — SpecifyScope: Define exact scope using completed work and modified files to prevent scope creep.
  - **CRITICAL**: Before dispatching review agent, provide what was actually implemented and files touched/modified; gives concrete scope boundaries regardless of work origin

**Review Scope Specification - Choose Appropriate Scenario:**

**Common File Format (All Scenarios):**
```
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `path/to/file.ext` ({created|modified|deleted} - {purpose/what changed})

**Related Files for Review:**
- `path/to/related.ext` ({imports|dependencies|tests|config})
```

#### **Scenario A: Work from Task List** (when `tasks.md` exists and was followed)
```
**Work Completed (from Task List):**
- Task 1.1: [exact task description from tasks.md]
- Task 1.2: [exact task description from tasks.md]
- Task 2.1: [exact task description from tasks.md]

[Use common file format above]
```

#### **Scenario B: Work from Plan** (working from `plan.md` without formal tasks)
```
**Work Completed (from Plan Implementation):**
- Implemented: [specific functionality completed, referencing plan.md sections]
- Delivered: [specific features/capabilities built]
- Completed: [specific plan items addressed]

[Use common file format above]

**Plan Context:**
- Plan Section: [specific sections of plan.md implemented]
- Plan Requirements: [requirements from plan this work addresses]
```

#### **Scenario C: Ad-hoc/Independent Work** (work without formal tasks or detailed plan)
```
**Work Completed (Independent Implementation):**
- Implemented: [specific functionality completed]
- Purpose: [why this work was done - bug fix, feature addition, etc.]
- Scope: [what was intended to be delivered]

[Use common file format above]

**Requirements Context:**
- Original Requirements: [extract from task_summary.md, PRD, or user request]
- Acceptance Criteria: [how success is defined for this work]
- Constraints: [any technical or scope constraints that applied]
```

- **Action** — ExtractWorkContext: Extract requirements and context from appropriate documentation based on scenario.
  - All scenarios: Extract work requirements → trace to origin docs (PRD/task_summary) → pull technical details → identify file context → document out-of-scope
  - **Scenario A**: Source from `tasks.md`
  - **Scenario B**: Source from `plan.md`/`quick_task_plan.md`
  - **Scenario C**: Source from task_summary.md/PRD/user comms; define acceptance criteria

## Step (2/4) - Dispatch Review Agent

- **Action** — GenerateReviewPrompt: Create comprehensive @spectre:reviewer subagent prompt replacing bracketed placeholders:

────────────────────────────────────
### 🔍 Comprehensive Code Review Agent Prompt

**Review Type:** Comprehensive Analysis (All Aspects)

**Work Completed for Review:**
[Choose appropriate format based on work origin - Scenario A, B, or C from Step 2]

**Files Modified/Created:**
[Complete list of files touched during implementation]
- `path/to/file1.py` (created - [brief purpose])
- `path/to/file2.py` (modified - [what was changed])
- `path/to/file3.py` (deleted - [reason])

**Related Files to Review:**
[Dependencies, tests, config files that may be impacted]
- `path/to/related1.py` (imports/dependencies)
- `path/to/test_file.py` (test coverage)
- `config/settings.py` (configuration changes)

**Requirements & Context:**
[Specific requirements and acceptance criteria for work completed - extracted from appropriate documentation based on scenario]

**Project Overview:**
[High‑level feature/bug description, requirements, acceptance criteria]

**Documentation Context:**
`docs/active_tasks/{task_name}/` (if available)
- Available docs: [list which exist: task_summary.md, prd.md, plan.md, tasks.md]
- Missing docs: [list which expected docs are missing]

**Guidelines & Preferences:**
[Style guides, architecture rules, naming conventions, test expectations]

---

#### Step 1: Context Collection & Code Identification

**FIRST: Gather Task Context**
1. **Read Task Documentation**: Locate and read files in `docs/active_tasks/{task_name}/`:
   - `task_summary.md` - Requirements and scope understanding
   - `initial_plan.md` or `plan.md` or `quick_task_plan.md` - Implementation approach
   - `tasks.md` or `{task_name}_tasks.md` - Specific work items and progress
   - `session_logs/` directory - Recent development progress and decisions

2. **Identify Code Scope**: Based on task documentation:
   - **Primary Files**: Files directly mentioned in plans and task lists
   - **Related Files**: Dependencies, imports, related modules
   - **Test Files**: Associated unit tests and integration tests
   - **Configuration**: Any config changes related to feature

3. **Explore Codebase**: Use codebase search tools to:
   - Find implementations mentioned in task documentation
   - Locate related functions, classes, modules
   - Identify recent changes related to task scope

**Code Review Scope Decision**: Focus review on code that:
- ✅ Is directly mentioned in task documentation
- ✅ Implements features described in plan
- ✅ Contains recent changes related to task objectives
- ✅ Has dependencies or impacts from primary implementation

#### Step 1.5: Work & File Scope Boundary Analysis & Validation

**CRITICAL: Establish Explicit Scope Boundaries Based on Completed Work & Modified Files**

**Work & File Scope Analysis (All Scenarios):**

**Step 1: Parse Completed Work** (scenario-specific):
- **Scenario A**: Extract task IDs (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) and descriptions from **Work Completed (Task List)** section
- **Scenario B**: Extract plan sections and functionality from **Work Completed (Plan)** section
- **Scenario C**: Extract implementation details and purpose from **Work Completed (Independent)** section

**Step 2: Extract Requirements** (scenario-specific sources):
- **Scenario A**: From tasks.md (acceptance criteria) → PRD/task_summary (origin requirements) → plan.md (technical approach)
- **Scenario B**: From plan.md (sections/acceptance) → PRD/task_summary (origin requirements)
- **Scenario C**: From task_summary.md/PRD/user comms (original requirements) → define success criteria → extract constraints

**Step 3: Analyze Modified Files** (universal):
- Understand role of each file in **Files Modified/Created** section
- Note change types (created, modified, deleted)
- Understand file relationships

**Step 4: Define Review Boundaries** (universal):
- **In-Scope**: Only work/files explicitly listed above
- **Out-of-Scope**: All other work not specifically listed, even if related
- **File Scope**: Only files in "Modified/Created" and "Related Files" sections

**Code Review Scope Boundaries:**

**IN SCOPE for This Review - Flag if Missing:**
- Only functionality required by **Work Completed** (tasks/plan/independent work) listed above
- Only code changes in **Files Modified/Created** and **Related Files** sections
- Technical requirements explicitly stated in work descriptions or requirements context
- Quality standards needed to meet specific acceptance criteria for completed work
- Security/performance requirements explicitly called out in work requirements

**OUT OF SCOPE for This Review - DO NOT Flag as Issues:**
- Work not listed in **Work Completed** section, even if related
- Files not listed in **Files Modified/Created** or **Related Files** sections
- Functionality from incomplete work, future tasks, or unimplemented plan sections
- Performance optimizations beyond completed work's stated requirements
- Additional features not mentioned in completed work descriptions
- "Best practice" implementations not required for specific work functionality
- Security enhancements beyond completed work's specified requirements
- Code organization improvements not needed for completed work
- Future-proofing or extensibility not explicitly requested in completed work
- Advanced error handling beyond completed work's basic requirements
- Aesthetic improvements beyond completed work's specified design requirements
- Capabilities planned for other work not included in this review scope

**Work & File Scope Validation Checkpoint:**
Before proceeding with code review, validate:
- [ ] Clear on which specific work was completed and needs review?
- [ ] Clear on which files were modified/created and need review?
- [ ] Identified specific requirements for completed work only?
- [ ] Clear on what work/files are NOT included in this review?
- [ ] Identified assumptions about "good practices" that aren't required for completed work?
- [ ] Will review focus ONLY on completed work and its associated files?
- [ ] Understand which work belongs to other parts vs completed work?

**If any validation fails, re-read Work Completed and Files sections and filter requirements focusing solely on work actually completed.**

**Critical Rule for Review Recommendations:**
- **Flag as Issues**: Only problems that prevent delivering **Work Completed** requirements
- **Suggest Improvements**: Only changes that directly support **Work Completed** acceptance criteria
- **DO NOT Flag**: Missing functionality from incomplete work, future plans, or different scopes
- **DO NOT Suggest**: Enhancements beyond minimal viable implementation for completed work

#### Step 2: Comprehensive Code Review Analysis

**Severity Scale Reference:**
- **CRITICAL**: Prevents execution, security vulnerabilities, auth bypasses, data exposure
- **HIGH**: Affects maintainability, core functionality, user experience, resource leaks
- **MEDIUM**: Quality improvements, test coverage, configuration, performance (non-critical)
- **LOW**: Documentation, polish, cleanup

**Perform comprehensive analysis covering all aspects:**

### 🔧 Foundation & Correctness

**1. Compile/Run Readiness** → CRITICAL if prevents execution
- Syntax errors, unresolved references, missing imports/modules
- Misconfigured build / dependency files

**2. Structural Soundness** → HIGH if affects maintainability

- Absence of required unit tests or placeholders for them

**4. Logic Validation** → CRITICAL if breaks functionality
- Off‑by‑one mistakes, null handling, obvious condition errors
- End‑to‑end scenario walkthroughs against requirements
- State transitions and error flows for all inputs

### 🛡️ Security & Safety

**Input Validation & Injection Prevention** → CRITICAL
- SQL injection: Parameterized queries, input sanitization
- XSS: Output encoding, Content Security Policy, input validation
- Command injection: Avoid system calls with user input
- Path traversal: Validate file paths, use safe path operations

**Authentication & Authorization** → CRITICAL for auth bypasses
- Broken authentication: Session management, password policies
- Privilege escalation: Role-based access control validation
- JWT security: Proper signing, expiration, secure storage
- API authentication: Rate limiting, token validation

**Data Protection** → CRITICAL for data exposure

- HTTPS enforcement: Secure transport, HSTS headers

### 🎯 Quality & Robustness

**5. Error Handling & User Safety** → HIGH if affects user experience
- Ensure graceful degradation and clear, user‑appropriate messages
- Detect error states that could block users or leak internal details

**6. Test Coverage & Quality** → MEDIUM if adequate coverage exists
- Measure unit/integration test breadth, branch coverage, boundary cases
- Point out missing negative tests and flaky patterns

**7. Performance Considerations** → HIGH if affects UX, MEDIUM otherwise
- O(n²) loops on large data, excessive network/DB calls, synchronous waits
- N+1 queries, blocking I/O on hot paths
- Inefficient algorithms, caching opportunities

**8. Code Quality & Maintainability** → MEDIUM
- Duplication & reusability: Copy‑pasted blocks, redundant utility functions
- Design consistency: Architecture layers, API contracts, dependency inversion
- Naming coherence, comment accuracy, adherence to style guides

### 🚀 Production Readiness

**9. Resource Management** → HIGH if causes leaks, MEDIUM otherwise
- Memory & resource leaks: Unclosed files/streams, lingering timers, event listeners, DB cursors
- Repeated allocations in tight loops, large object retention

**10. Infrastructure & Configuration** → MEDIUM
- Insecure dependencies: Known CVEs, outdated packages
- Security headers: CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- Error handling: No sensitive info in error messages
- Logging security: No credentials in logs, log injection prevention

**11. Documentation & Developer UX** → LOW
- Up‑to‑date README, code comments, public API docs
- Log levels appropriate, no PII in logs, actionable messages

**12. Final Polish** → LOW
- Remove unused functions, constants, feature flags, debug prints
- Ensure commit history or diff is clean and scoped

Respond to user with summary of only high priority items and point to file. Do not perform fixes yourself.

### Final Important Note

We are a startup building an early stage product hoping to find Product Market Fit. We must avoid over-engineering like the plague. Stick to YAGNI + SOLID + KISS + DRY principles. All recommendations, while comprehensive, should not over complicate the product or architecture for the stage that we're in.

**CRITICAL**: Your review must respect explicit **Work Completed** and **Files Modified/Created** boundaries specified above. DO NOT flag missing features from incomplete work or different scopes. DO NOT suggest improvements beyond what is explicitly requested in completed work. Focus only on ensuring code delivers what was specifically asked for in completed work, not entire project scope.
