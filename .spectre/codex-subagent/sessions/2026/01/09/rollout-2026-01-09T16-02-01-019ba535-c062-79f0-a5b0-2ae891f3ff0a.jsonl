It's a meta-prompt orchestration system where prompts invoke subagents that execute specialized prompts.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\ncommands/           # 23 markdown command prompts (scope.md, plan.md, execute.md, etc.)\nagents/             # 7 specialized subagent definitions (@coder, @analyzer, @locator, etc.)\nhooks/              # Python hooks for session memory\n  hooks.json        # Hook registration\n  scripts/          # handoff-resume.py, capture-todos.py\nreferences/         # Shared reference docs injected into prompts\n.claude-plugin/     # Plugin registration (plugin.json, marketplace.json)\ndocs/               # Generated artifacts (scope docs, plans, handoff state)\n```\n\n## Commands\n\nRun tests:\n```bash\npytest hooks/scripts/test_handoff_resume.py\n```\n\nNo build or lint commands - this is a prompt/configuration-only plugin.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Meta-Prompt Orchestration\nCommands are markdown prompts that:\n1. Read user arguments\n2. Spawn parallel subagents (`@spectre:coder`, `@spectre:analyzer`, etc.)\n3. Subagents execute their specialized prompts\n4. Main prompt synthesizes findings and produces artifacts\n\n### Wave-Based Execution\n`execute.md` groups tasks into dependency-aware waves that run in parallel, with reflection and adaptation between waves.\n\n### Session Memory (Hooks)\nTwo Python hooks maintain context across sessions:\n- **SessionStart** (`handoff-resume.py`): Restores previous session context from `docs/` handoff files\n- **UserPromptSubmit** (`capture-todos.py`): Captures todos when `/spectre:handoff` is triggered\n\nBoth use `os.fork()` for non-blocking background processing.\n\n### Generated Artifacts\nCommands create files in `docs/active_tasks/{branch}/`:\n- `{task}_scope.md` - Scope boundaries\n- `{task}_plan.md` - Implementation plan\n- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown\n- `{timestamp}_handoff.json` - Session state\n- `{timestamp}_todos.json` - Captured todos\n\n## Key Patterns\n\n### Hook Non-Blocking Pattern\n```python\npid = os.fork()\nif pid == 0:\n    do_work()  # Child does I/O\n    os._exit(0)\nelse:\n    sys.exit(0)  # Parent returns immediately\n```\n\n### Command Flow\nEvery command ends with contextual \"Next Steps\" suggestions. Follow them—they're grounded in actual codebase state.\n\n### Subagent Invocation\nCommands spawn agents like `@spectre:codebase-analyzer` for parallel research. Agents return file:line references, not generic advice.\n\n## Working in This Repo\n\n- **Adding commands**: Create markdown in `commands/` following existing patterns (ARGUMENTS parsing, EXECUTION FLOW, Next Steps output)\n- **Adding agents**: Create markdown in `agents/` with role, mission, and methodology sections\n- **Modifying hooks**: Update Python scripts in `hooks/scripts/`, run tests, ensure non-blocking behavior\n- **Testing hooks**: `pytest hooks/scripts/test_handoff_resume.py -v`\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Commands always use `/spectre:` prefix (e.g., `/spectre:scope`)\n- Session state lives in `docs/` and `.claude/spectre/` (both gitignored)\n- Hooks use Python 3 standard library only (no external dependencies)\n- `os.fork()` is Unix-only—Windows compatibility not yet implemented\n"}}
