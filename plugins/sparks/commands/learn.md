# /learn - Capture Project Knowledge

Load the @skill:`sparks-learn` skill and follow its instructions.

**Arguments provided**: $ARGUMENTS

## Proactive Skill Updates

If you loaded a skill earlier in this session (via `Skill({name})`) and subsequently:
- Discovered the skill was incomplete, outdated, or wrong
- Learned something new that extends the skill's coverage
- Found better patterns, files, or approaches than documented
- Debugged an issue the skill should have warned about

**You should offer to update that skill** before the session ends.

When invoking `/learn` in this case:
1. Reference the skill you loaded: "I'd update the skill: `{skill-name}`"
2. Show what changed: current vs. proposed
3. Follow the UPDATE flow in the sparks-learn skill

This keeps knowledge fresh without requiring users to remember to call `/learn`.
